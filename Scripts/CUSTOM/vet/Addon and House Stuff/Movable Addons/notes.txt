-Version 2008-10-08
	-fixed a crash bug when trying to place the carpet in a Multi (thanks Lord_Greywolf!)
-Version 2008-10-07
	-modified code a bit so this will work on RunUO 2.0 RC1 (thanks Gargouille!)



Compatibility:
--------------

This was developed using a freshly downloaded RunUO 2.0 SVN server, and tweaked to run on a RunUO 2.0 RC1 server.

-RunUO 2.0 SVN version 300 (downloaded October 7, 2008)
-RunUO 2.0 RC1 (need to modify MovableAddon.cs for this to work on RC1 - instructions are provided in that file)

Notes:
------

-Use of this package should require little understanding of how it works.

-There are no server modifications required to run this.  Simply drop and run!

Overview:
-------------

Movable addons are a collection of items that look and behave similar to the well-known Addon class.  A collection of component items
define the movable addon, and when the addon moves, the components move with it like a unified body.  What distinguishes movable 
addons from the traditional addons is that a "direction" is defined both in the movable addon and its components.  This direction
is used to negotiate rotation considerations, as well as player control.  In a sense, a movable addon is almost like a hybrid between
an addon and a boat.

The main components of a movable addon include:
-the movable addon object itself
-the movable addon component pieces which make up the visible collection of items
-a special "controller" movable addon component which watches for verbal commands, and is used for player control interfacing
-a separate "key" item, which grants the player access to create, control, store, and customize their movable addon

A movable addon in and of itself is not a functional object, but inherited classes can be defined to create a working object.  Currently,
the only working example is the flying carpet.  Players can place a flying carpet, and use commands similar to a boat to drive.  
In addition to boat commands, the commands "up", "down", "take off", and "land" allow the flying carpet to navigate the z-direction.  
There is also the "fast" speed command, which can be used to specify a larger step size when travelling.  For example, boat drivers
will be familiar with "forward", "forward slow", "forward one", but not "forward fast".  

The key object for the flying carpet is a magic lamp (constructable item FlyingCarpetMagicLamp).  When this item is created, the 
carpet design type is randomly selected.  The magic lamp allows the player to create their carpet, much like a ship deed, or drydocked ship.  
When a player uses this item in their backpack, they are given a targeting cursor to place the carpet.  The user can also customize 
their carpet layout and appearance by using the Customize context menu entry on the magic lamp.  Customization requires Magic thread 
(constructable item MagicThread), and can only be performed when the flying carpet is "furled" or stored.  Double-clicking the magic 
lamp while not riding the carpet will attempt to recall the user to the carpet.

The controller object for the flying carpet is a "genie" which sits at the back of the carpet and chatters when the user speaks commands.
The genie will only respond to the player who is carrying the corresponding magic lamp in their backpack.  As an alternate mode of 
control, the user can can double click the genie while riding the carpet to bring up a navigation control panel.  Double-clicking the
genie while not riding the carpet will attempt to "furl" the carpet.  When the user confirms this, the carpet ceases to exist, and 
the user can customize the carpet.  The user can place the carpet again by double-clicking the lamp again.

The Flying Carpet requires power crystals as an energy source, and will be usable for 24 hours for each provided piece.  The
player can refuel the carpet through the navigation control panel, accessible by double clicking the genie while riding the carpet.  The
carpet will not consume power when it is "furled".

The carpet can by dyed through the use of a flying carpet dye tub (constructable item FlyingCarpetDyeTub).

Various parameters are developer-configurable, such as the energy requirement, the resource required for customization, and so on.
Other parameters, such as the restriction of carpet travel to certain maps and locations, are also set up and can be easily defined.

Finally, there is no provision for how the magic lamp, carpet dye tub, or magic thread are implemented.  I leave it up to the 
developer to determine their preferred method of distribution of these items to their players.
